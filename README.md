# LyricScard

> Turn the lines that hit hardest into a card you can share.

Search a song, pick the lyrics that wreck you, and walk away with a Spotify- or Apple-Music-style card you can drop into a story, a tweet, or a group chat. Vanilla JS on the front, a thin Node + Vercel backend on the back, Spotify/Lastfm for song metadata, and [lrclib](https://lrclib.net/docs) (with a couple of fallbacks) for lyrics.

## The 60-second tour

Search → pick the right track → highlight the lines that matter → tune the card.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src=".screenshots/03-search-results.png" alt="Song search results"></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src=".screenshots/04-pick-lines.png" alt="Picking lyric lines"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><sub>Pick the right one — usually it's the first hit.</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><sub>Tap the lines you want. The FAB shows up when you've got at least one.</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Then it's all sliders and toggles until the card looks the way you want, and the download button hands you a high-res PNG.

    <td width="50%"><img src=".screenshots/06-card-apple-music.png" alt="Apple Music-style lyric card with blurred artwork background"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><sub>Spotify style — the original.</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><sub>Apple Music style — uses the album art as a blurred background.</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

It runs on phones too — the controls collapse into a single column and the card stays the centerpiece:

Light mode is right there in the footer if you'd rather:

## Run it locally

You need **Node 18+** and the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli):

```bash
npm i -g vercel
cp .env.example .env.local        # then paste your LASTFM_API_KEY
vercel dev
```

`vercel dev` serves the static files at <http://localhost:3000> and runs each `api/*.js` handler as a serverless function.

> No Last.fm key? Grab one in 60 seconds at <https://www.last.fm/api/account/create>.

## Deploy

```bash
vercel              # first time: link or create the project
vercel --prod       # ship it
```

Then in the Vercel dashboard: **Project → Settings → Environment Variables → add `LASTFM_API_KEY`**.

## What's under the hood

```
api/
  search.js          Spotsearch → Last.fm fallback, returns a normalized song list
  lyrics.js          concurrent lrc.red (ISRC) + lrclib with StefDP fallback, returns the first valid hit
classes/
  data/              Artist, Lyric, Song models
  DataFetcher.js     thin client for /api/*
  DOMHandler.js      the wizard — screen routing, line selection, card rendering
  NoiseButton.js     the subtle grain overlay on primary buttons
styles/              main.css (tokens + shell), wizard.css, song-image.css
index.html           single-page app
index.js             wires fetcher + handler
vercel.json          function config + headers
```

Cards render in the DOM (no canvas hacks) and get exported via [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) at 2× scale. Album art and brand wordmarks are pre-tinted on a canvas so html2canvas doesn't have to. The dominant card color is sampled from the cover by scoring pixels on saturation × mid-lightness, with a curated random palette as a fallback.
